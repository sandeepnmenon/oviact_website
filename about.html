          <h2>Why we’re building Oviact</h2>
          <p>
            PCOD and PCOS are chronic conditions that touch every part of life—from
            cycles and fertility to mood, sleep and energy. Too often, women track
            pieces of this story across multiple apps, notes and lab reports.
          </p>
          <p>
            We want to bring these pieces together. Oviact focuses on patterns,
            helping you see how hormones, lifestyle and symptoms connect, and making
            it easier to have informed conversations with your OB/GYN.
